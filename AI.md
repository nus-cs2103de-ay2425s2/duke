### Week 3 Tasks
- Created a project in ChatGPT and uploaded relevant files to provide context.
- Provided instructions with reference to the weekly tasks and asked GPT to generate starter code based on it
- Refined generated code by providing additional prompts to specify the requirements of the tasks.
- Used Copilot to autocomplete some manual coding sections.

**Reflection**<br>
The tasks for Week 3 are relatively simple, so GPT was able to generate the code with minimal guidance. 
The generated code was quite accurate and usually required only minor modifications.
